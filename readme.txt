The Ultimate Icon Font Addon for Visual Composer

== Description ==

4k icons is a [Visual Composer](http://codecanyon.net/item/visual-composer-page-builder-for-wordpress/242431?ref=bfintal) shortcode add-on that gives you the awesome ability to use over 4,000 font icons in your WordPress site. You can add background shapes to your icons, adjust the size and colors, apply different hover effects, and align them to suit your every need.

4k Icons was built to have all the icons you would ever want and need. We have a lot of social icons which you can turn into links. We even have all the US states as icons just in case you need them.

Created using [Titan Framework](http://wordpress.org/plugins/titan-framework/) and [Titan Framework Shortcode Extension](http://codecanyon.net/item/titan-framework-shortcode-extension/7009811?ref=bfintal)
